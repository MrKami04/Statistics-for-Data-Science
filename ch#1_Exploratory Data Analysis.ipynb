    "- there are two basic types of structured data; **numeric and categorical**. \n",

    "- **categorical** takes only fixed set of values such as TV screen\n",
    "- **binary data** is important special case of categorical data that takes only one of two values such as 0/1, yes/no or true/ false.\n",
    "- categorical types is **ordinal data **: in which categories are ordered as numerical rating(1,2,3,4,5) stars.\n",
    "- why data type **important**: To help determine the type of visual display, data analysis or statistical model and improve computational performance"
